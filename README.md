## Using tenserflow keras library
Flask as framwork

its simply webpage that can predict  handwritten digits

can save a last operation as 'output.png' in root direction

before you run this .py file you need download and install tenserflow,keras and flask

# tenserflow 
TensorFlow provides multiple APIs. The lowest level API--TensorFlow Core-- provides you with complete programming control. We recommend TensorFlow Core for machine learning researchers and others who require fine levels of control over their models. The higher level APIs are built on top of TensorFlow Core. These higher level APIs are typically easier to learn and use than TensorFlow Core. In addition, the higher level APIs make repetitive tasks easier and more consistent between different users. A high-level API like tf.estimator helps you manage data sets, estimators, training and inference

# keras
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

[kreas install](https://keras.io/#installation)
# flask 
Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions

[flask install](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation/)
# how to run this file
first you need get my files then type blow code on your CMD

```git clone https://github.com/neroZWX/python-project```

 then go to the directory
 
``` cd python-project```

set flask-server

``` set FLASK_APP=app.py```

run flask-server

```flask run```

open your browser then type "localhost:5000/"
